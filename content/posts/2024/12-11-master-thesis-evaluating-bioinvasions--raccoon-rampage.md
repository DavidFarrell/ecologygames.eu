Pamela Neff's Master's thesis explores the effectiveness of "BioInvasions: Raccoon Rampage", a board game designed to educate players about the complexities of managing invasive species, specifically raccoons in Europe.

## Main Findings: A Positive Impact
The thesis examines whether playing the game leads to a better understanding of the problems associated with raccoons and the need for cooperation in developing effective management strategies. It also explores whether playing the game can change players' perceptions of raccoons.

The study involved 86 participants who completed questionnaires both before and after playing the game. The questionnaires used a mixed-methods approach, including both closed and open-ended questions. This allowed Neff to assess both knowledge levels and the participants' perceptions and motivations.

The results indicate that playing "Raccoon Rampage" led to a significant increase in knowledge about invasive species and the challenges of managing them.

* Specifically, participants showed increased awareness of the problems caused by raccoons and the need for a combination of different management measures involving cooperation between various stakeholders.
* Additionally, the game seems to have prompted a shift in perceptions of raccoons.
  * Before playing, many participants held predominantly positive views of raccoons.
  * After playing, however, they expressed more neutral and informed perspectives, acknowledging both the animals' appealing traits and the threat they pose as an invasive species.

## Limitations and Future Directions

The thesis also acknowledges some limitations of the study and suggests avenues for future research:

* While the game effectively raises awareness of the problems caused by invasive species, it doesn't go into great detail about the specific problems caused by raccoons. Future iterations of the game could incorporate more detailed information about the ecological and economic impacts of raccoon invasion.
* Some participants found the game quite complex, which might have hindered their learning experience. Future research could focus on simplifying the game mechanics while still maintaining the core educational objectives.
* The study relied on self-reported data from questionnaires. Future research could incorporate more objective measures of learning, such as pre- and post-tests that assess factual knowledge about invasive species.
* The study focused on a single invasive species (raccoons) in a specific geographical context (Europe). It would be interesting to investigate whether the findings can be generalized to other invasive species and regions.

Overall, Neff's research suggests that "Raccoon Rampage" has potential as a tool for public education about invasive species. By incorporating more detailed information and addressing the complexity issue, the game could be even more effective in raising awareness and promoting informed decision-making about this critical environmental challenge.
