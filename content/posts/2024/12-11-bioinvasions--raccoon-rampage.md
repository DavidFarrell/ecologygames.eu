BioInvaders: Raccoon Rampage is a semi-cooperative board game where players take on roles like environmental agencies, hunters, or animal rights lobbyists, each with their own unique agenda. While working together to prevent raccoons from wreaking ecological havoc across Europe, players must also balance collaboration with rivalries to achieve their personal objectives.

Developed as part of EU-funded research projects InvaSiBES and AlienScenarios, the game distils complex socio-ecological challenges into an accessible and engaging format. Players engage in strategic planning and social negotiation, proposing and voting on policies while leveraging action cards to shape outcomes. Designed for 3-4 players aged 12 and up, the game offers a playtime of 45-60 minutes and is available for free on Tabletopia.
